### TECHNICAL TEST - MAKING COMPANY WEBSITE

## This test is intended to pass the technical test for frontend developer position in Altech Omega Andalan

# Technologies used

- This project is developed with TypeScript as programming language, as it provides better code readibility and maintainability by defining types for variables, functions, and return values. This makes the overall code to be much more easier to read and understand for beginners.

- I am using React along with Vite and SWC that provides fast development server. Vite also helps optimize build process by bundling only the dependencies that are actually used in application.

- For styling, I am using Tailwind CSS instead of SASS, as it provides rapid development and utility-first approach, so I can quickly make components with simpler styles that looks good already. Tailwind also provides flexible customization and consistent design system.

- I am using React Router DOM that handles routing in a declarative way, where I can define the routes with JSX syntax, and much easier set up and visualization.

- For other styling, I am using combination of Heroic Icons and Headless UI where it provides support with Tailwind CSS, as both components are supported by Tailwind CSS and can be easily modified.
